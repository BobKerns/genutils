<p>Generator utilities that bring array-like operations like map, filter, slice, some, every, and more
to sync and async generators. Instead of producing arrays, these operations produce new generators.</p>
<p>Generators can be enhanced with new methods, or functional programming can be used to construct
operators on generators.</p>
<p>Typeguard predicates and coercion functions are provided for iterators, iterables, and generators,
both synchronous and asynchronous.</p>
<p>An enhanced implementation of the common range() function is provided, which allows mapping and
filtering, and demonstrates the enhanced functionality.</p>
