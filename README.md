# Generator Utilities (genutils)

Genutils is a package of utilities that enhance synchronous and asynchronous generators. They can be given enhanced array-like methods like map, slice, filter,
or you can use the functional interface to create filters tha accept a generator and return a transformed (and enhanced) generator.

Where the array methods would return a new array, these methods and higher-order-functions return new generators.

For more information, please see [the documentation.](docs/index.html).
